> "The Story of My Life"

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

A personal and family blog/journal/diary app, as a searchable library for media,
articles, maps, etc., presented in a timeline. Don't know exactly where this is going,
but it's a start at something a friend and I have always wanted, something like
ancestry.com would be great, but not in the cloud and with an easy quick way to make
more frequent entries of other media besides the familial relationships.

Forked from Austin-Scott's Mnemosyne, because I intended to use jrnl.sh, but I had
a mysql diary already started and I want an additional _end-date_ field for events
spanning periods of time. I like his mobile app that uses Northwestern's timeline.
Looks like his new version is going into the time management direction instead of
just a personal diary.
